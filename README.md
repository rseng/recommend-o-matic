# Recommend-o-matic

The recommend-o-matic is a web interface that makes it easy to display
a list of options alongside filters, with the ultimate goal being to help
a user make a choice. It is developed generically to be useful for multiple
cases, such as:

 - Compute
 - Storage

To get started, read the [documentation](https://stanford-rc.github.io/recommend-o-matic/) served alongside the repository,
or jump right into the [demo](https://stanford-rc.github.io/recommend-o-matic/demo/horizontal-layout/).

## Possible Features

The following features would be fairly easy to do! [Let me know](https://github.com/stanford-rc/recommend-o-matic/issues)
if you'd like to request or work on one.

 - **GitHub Workflow**: It would be fairly easy to create a workflow to download a set of sheets, validate and generate updated data, and then deploy an updated interface. If you are interested in automation, this feature would be useful to you.
 - **Sorting**: Currently, rows are not sortable, but they could be (based on group or category)
 - **Labels**: An additional level of labels (also based on group or category) could be used to help visually group.

And of course, if you have ideas or feedback, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/stanford-rc/recommend-o-matic/issues)!
