Faculty can supplement these shared nodes by purchasing additional servers, thus becoming Sherlock owners. By becoming an owner, your group will not only have exclusive use of purchased nodes, but will have access to the over 1,300 owner compute nodes. Thus far, owners from more than 140 research groups have added compute nodes to Sherlock for their team's exclusive use.",

Nero is managed by experienced IT staff to meet data security requirements. Researchers can focus on science, so there is no need to deal with the hassle, expense, and risk of operating and maintaining their own servers. Standard analytical software like Jupyter Notebook, STATA and R are also updated and patched by the IT staff. Nero is designed to support Big Data team science. Big Data research benefits from the availability of High Risk and PHI compliant environments, whether for analysis of social network data or health data. Nero brings the analytical communities across different disciplines together to work in a collaborative and secure environment.",
